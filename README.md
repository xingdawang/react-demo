### Purpose
This project is designed for the React presentation demo.

It gives users `Theory` and `Practice` options for the next series, and allow users to select between these two categories. The higher level topics and more advanced tools will be in the category `Theory`, which contains [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) at the moment. And for the users who prefer practical exercises, there will be an exercise from `ECMASCript 6` (`ES6`), followed with two small projects, one is `Gallery` which using [React](https://reactjs.org/) to build a image wall; the other is to create a `Health Calculator` to help user manage their health conditions.

### Design & Implementation
#### Design
##### Programming Paradigm
As the purpose of this application is to get user preference, which is data orientated. the programming paradigm used here is: [Data-Driven Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-driven_programming).
##### UI/UX Design
> Create a visual language that synthesizes classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science.
> 
> Develop a single underlying system that allows for a unified experience across platforms and device sizes. Mobile precepts are fundamental, but touch, voice, mouse, and keyboard are all Ô¨Årst-class input methods.

* Thus the visual design locked using: [Material Design Design](https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html#)
* Usability focus, idea from [Don't make me think](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758)

#### Implementation
##### Cloud Computing
Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Frontend / Backend
Frontend: React & Redux / Design pattern
Backend: GraphCool
#### Styling
Mobile First
